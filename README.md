How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

How I can make programs maintainable and readable by following best practice coding styles. I think the use of comments has been helpful in breaking the task up into smaller parts to tackle. I think that the different modules functioned well in an OOP style making it esier to implement and more readable.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems by breaking it down into what I know and what I don't know sections and after this I create small tasks in order to work on them in short sprints. Considering the approach to database and dashboard requirements I think my approach for this project is pretty similar to my other courses becaue I like to break down the work into different tasks. Treating each request as a small taks to complete and test is what I find most successful.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scienteists solve problems that arise in a work or academic environment. There is always more than one answer to these unique problems, but with experience we can find similar patterns that helpus find a solution. The type of work done in this project would help a company by providing an easier accesss to their vital information. As companies begin to collect more data it will be important to be able to extract useful information from this data.
